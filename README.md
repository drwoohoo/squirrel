# squirrel
The objective of the Squirrel app is to sample colors from an imported image and then to save each one as a color palette int array to be used later in a different Processing sketch. Colors are sampled by drawing a line across the image. The line is segmented into x-number of points, with colors sampled at each step and saved into an array.
