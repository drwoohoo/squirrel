# squirrel
The objective of the Squirrel app is to sample colors from an imported image and then to save each one as a color palette int array to be used later in a different Processing sketch. Colors are sampled by drawing a line across the image. The line is segmented into x-number of points, with colors sampled at each step and saved into an array. The color array can be exported as a TXT file with the colors saved in a easy to use format to program with at a later point.

The Color_Cycle code is included as a reference to working with the exported color palette arrays saved from Squirrel.

Squirrel was developed in Processing (https://processing.org).
